The `src/library`

not to be confused with `src/modules/thirdparty`, this directory acts like the standard library (`std::*`) from C++

`src/modules/thirdparty` contains third-party modules from the Roblox community.

while this directory contains alternative modules from `src/core/variant` and approach it with a more functional programming style. And contains methods and features that we actually need.
